# URL-Shortener
This is a URL- Shortener that I've made to help users of Bitly to shorten their URL with ease and zero hassle. It was inspired by one of the projects that I've done in university which I then elevated it by incorporating Bitly API and included a login functionality as well.

## How to install the dependencies
Firsly, install all the dependencies by:

``
pip install -r requirements.txt
``

``
npm install
``

By doing the steps above, you'll be able to download all the dependencies used in this project with ease

## How to start the project
To start the project, simply :

``
python app.py
``

# What do you need prior to using this website?
- You'll need a Bitly account (Fear not, there is a sign up link for you in this project that directs you to a Bitly sign up page)
- An URL that you want to shorten

## Feedback
Please drop any feedback and let me know what I can improve further upon

## Challenges
- It was quite challenging to figure out the way Bitly API works but was able to overcome it after intensive researches from sources like Youtube
- It was definitely interesting to design the website to look the way I desire it to be but nevertheless, a rewarding experience

## Conclusion
Thank you for viewing this project as I'll continue to improve on my skills in both programming as well as designing the website itself
