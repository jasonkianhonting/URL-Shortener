# URL-Shortener
This is a URL- Shortener that I've made to help users of Bitly to shorten their URL

## How to use
Firsly, install all the dependencies by:

``
pip install -r requirements.txt
``

``
npm install
``

By doing the steps above, you'll be able to download all the dependencies used in this project at ease

# What do you need prior to using this website?
- You'll need a Bitly account (Fear not, there is a sign up link for you in this project that directs you to a Bitly sign up page)
- An URL that you want to shorten

## Feedback
Please drop any feedback and let me know what I can improve further upon

## Challenges
- It was quite challenging to figure out the way Bitly API works but was able to overcome it after intensive researches from sources like Youtube
- It was definitely interesting to design the website to look the way I desire it to be but nevertheless, a rewarding experience

## Conclusion
Thank you for viewing this project as I'll continue to improve on my skills in both programming as well as designing the website itself
